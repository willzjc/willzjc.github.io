                <div id="first-two" class="tracking-section">
                    <h2> First, some intuition </h2>
                    <p> Let&rsquo;s&nbsp;say you had to determine whether a home is in <strong style="color:rgb(255, 10, 10);"> San Francisco</strong> or in <strong style="color:rgb(1, 1, 1);">New York</strong>. In machine learning terms, categorizing data
                        points is a <strong>classification</strong> task. </p>
                    <p> Since San Francisco is relatively hilly, the elevation of a home may be a good way to distinguish the two cities. </p>
                    <p> Based on the home-elevation data to the right, you could argue that a home above 73 meters should be <strong> classified</strong> as one in San Francisco. </p>
                </div>
                <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 40vh;" />
                <div id="add-nuance">
                    <h2> Adding nuance </h2>
                    <p> Adding another <strong>dimension</strong> allows for more nuance. For example, New York apartments can be extremely expensive per square foot. </p>
                    <p> So visualizing elevation <em>and</em> price per square foot in a <strong>scatterplot</strong> helps us distinguish lower-elevation homes. </p>
                    <p> The data suggests that, among homes at or below 73 meters, those that cost more than $19,116.7 per square meter are in New York City. </p>
                    <p> Dimensions in a data set are called <strong>features</strong>, <strong>predictors</strong>, or <strong>variables</strong>. <span class="footnote-anchor"></span></p>
                </div>
                <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 30vh;" />
                <div id="set-boundaries" class="tracking-section">
                    <h2> Drawing boundaries </h2>
                    <p> You can visualize your elevation (>73 m) and price per square foot (>$19,116.7) observations as the boundaries of regions in your scatterplot. Homes plotted in the green and blue regions would be in San Francisco and New York, respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p> Identifying boundaries in data using math is the essence of statistical learning. </p>
                    <p> Of course, you&rsquo;ll need additional information to distinguish homes with lower elevations <em>and</em> lower per-square-foot prices. </p>
                </div>

                        <!--<div id="data-table"></div>-->
                        <p> The dataset used to create the model has 7 different dimensions. Creating a model is also known as <strong>training</strong> a model. </p>
                        <p> On the right, we are visualizing the variables in a <strong>scatterplot matrix</strong> to show the relationships between each pair of dimensions. </p>
                        <p> There are clearly patterns in the data, but the boundaries for delineating them are not obvious. </p>

                        <h2> And now, machine learning </h2>
                        <p> Finding patterns in data is where machine learning comes in. Machine learning methods use statistical learning to identify boundaries. </p>
                        <p> One example of a machine learning method is a <strong>decision tree</strong>. Decision trees look at one variable at a time and are a reasonably accessible (though rudimentary) machine learning method. </p>
                    </div>

                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 20vh;" />
                    <h2> Finding better boundaries </h2>
                    <p> Let's revisit the 73-m elevation boundary proposed previously to see how we can improve upon our intuition. </p>
                    <p> Clearly, this requires a different perspective. </p>
                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 40vh;" />
                    <p> By transforming our visualization into a <strong>histogram</strong>, we can better see how frequently homes appear at each elevation. </p>
                    <p> While the highest home in New York is 73m, the majority of them seem to have far lower elevations. </p>

                </div>
                <div id="introduce-split" class="tracking-section">
                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 30vh;" />
                    <h2>Your first fork</h2>
                    <p> A decision tree uses if-then statements to define patterns in data. </p>
                    <p> For example, <strong>if</strong> a home's elevation is above some number, <strong>then</strong> the home is probably in San Francisco. </p>

                </div>
                <div id="explain-gini" class="tracking-section">
                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 30vh;" />
                    <p> In machine learning, these statements are called <strong>forks</strong>, and they split the data into two <strong>branches</strong> based on some value. </p>
                    <p> That value between the branches is called a <strong>split point</strong>. Homes to the left of that point get categorized in one way, while those to the right are categorized in another. A split point is the decision tree's version
                        of a boundary. </p>

                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 50vh;" />
                    <h2>Tradeoffs</h2>
                    <p> Picking a split point has tradeoffs. Our initial split (~73 m) incorrectly classifies some San Francisco homes as New York ones. </p>
                    <p> Look at that large slice of green in the left pie chart, those are all the San Francisco homes that are misclassified. These are called <strong>false negatives</strong>. </p>

                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 50vh;" />
                    <p> However, a split point meant to capture every San Francisco home will include many New York homes as well. These are called <strong>false&nbsp;positives</strong>. </p>
                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 50vh;" />

                    <h2>The best split</h2>
                    <p> At the <strong>best split</strong>, the results of each branch should be as homogeneous (or pure) as possible. There are several mathematical methods you can choose between to calculate the best split.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span></p>
                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 20vh;" />
                    <p>As we see here, even the best split on a single feature does not fully separate the San Francisco homes from the New York ones.</p>
                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 10vh;" />
                </div>
                <div id="further-split" class="tracking-section">
                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 30vh;" />
                    <h2>Recursion</h2>
                    <p>To add another split point, the algorithm repeats the process above on the subsets of data. This repetition is called <strong>recursion</strong>, and it is a concept that appears frequently in training models.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span></p>

                    <p class="small">The histograms to the left show the distribution of each subset, repeated for each variable.</p>
                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 30vh;" />
                    <p>The best split will vary based which branch of the tree you are looking at.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span></p>
                    <p>For lower elevation homes, price per square foot is, at $1061 per sqft, is the best variable for the next if-then statement. For higher elevation homes, it is price, at $514,500</p>.

                    <p>You could even continue to add branches until the tree's predictions are <strong>100% accurate</strong>, so that at the end of every branch, the homes are purely in San Francisco or purely in New York.</p>

                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 35vh;" />
                    <p>Because the tree was grown until it was 100% accurate, this tree maps each training data point perfectly to which city it is in.</p>

                    <h2>Reality check</h2>
                    <p>Of course, what matters more is how the tree performs on previously-unseen data.</p>
                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 40vh;" />
                    <p>To <strong>test</strong> the tree's performance on new data, we need to apply it to data points that it has never seen before. This previously unused data is called <strong>test data</strong>.</p>
                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 40vh;" />
                    <p>Ideally, the tree should perform similarly on both known and unknown data.</p>
                    <hr class="whitespace" style="height: 25vh;" />
                    <p>So this one is less than ideal.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span></p>

                        <li>Machine learning identifies patterns using <strong>statistical learning</strong> and computers by unearthing <strong>boundaries</strong> in data sets. You can use it to make predictions.</li>
                        <li>One method for making predictions is called a decision trees, which uses a series of if-then statements to identify boundaries and define patterns in the data.</li>

                        <li>Machine learning concepts have arisen across disciplines (Finance, economics, markets, computer science, statistics, engineering, psychology, etc), thus the different nomenclature.</li>
                        <li>To learn more about calculating the optimal split, search for 'gini index' or 'cross entropy'</li>
                        <li>One reason computers are so good at applying statistical learning techniques is that they're able to do repetitive tasks, very quickly and without getting bored.</li>
                        <li>The algorithm described here is <em>greedy</em>, because it takes a top-down approach to splitting the data. In other words, it is looking for the variable that makes each subset the most homogeneous <em>at that moment</em>.</li>
                        <li>Hover over the dots to see the path it took in the tree.</li>
                        <li>Spoiler alert: It's the bias/variance tradeoff!</li>
