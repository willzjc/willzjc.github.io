This example created for development purposes using the [d3-sankey](https://github.com/d3/d3-sankey) plugin for D3 4.0.

Based on [xaranke's port](http://bl.ocks.org/xaranke/9ada4c74a87b57ae7308) of [Mike Bostock's Sankey Diagram](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/sankey/) with drag behavior enabled and several fixes for the d3 version 4.x release.

It would be nice if d3-sankey's `value` accessor was configurable, to avoid creating the `empty_links` data structure in the code below.
