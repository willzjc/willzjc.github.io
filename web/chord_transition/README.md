Chord Diagram with transitions to see sentiments of each year

===============================================

Forked from below:

This Chord diagram was created to show the Fish Trade Flows in US dollars between world regions. To show how the exports change through the years I used transitions between the chords. This was possible thanks to a stack overflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21813723/change-and-transition-dataset-in-chord-diagram-with-d3) by [AmeliaBR](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3128209/ameliabr).

The data was obtained from [FAO Fisheries Yearbooks](http://www.fao.org/fishery/publications/yearbooks/en). It spans 9 years, from 2004 to 2015. The final version of this visualization can be viewed at [Databyou](http://www.databyou.com/chord/chordi/chordi.html).

This research was funded by the project SAF21 - Social science aspects of fisheries for the 21st Century. SAF21 is a project financed under the EU Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie (MSC) – ITN - ETN programme (project 642080).
